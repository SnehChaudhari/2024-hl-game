**** Instructions ****

To begin, choose the number of rounds and either customise 
the game parameters or go with the default game (where the 
secret number will be between 1 and 100).

Then choose how many rounds you'd like to play <enter> for 
infinite mode.

Your goal is to try to guess the secret number without 
running out of guesses.

 Good luck.
